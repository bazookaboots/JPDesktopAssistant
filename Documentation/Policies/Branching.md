# Branching

The main branch will contain a copy of the working code.

The dev branch will contain a copy of the developing code.

Each team member will have their own branch to work on different features.

At the end of each sprint, the team will meet and merge the development branch into main.

Nobody is to merge with main until the group has discussed.
