# Junior Project: Desktop Assistant for Gamers

## Description
Leveraging Google assistant API, Electron, and others, to develop an AI assistant for the “PC gamer” demographic. This is a three-term team project in its early stages.

## Members
* Bailey Goins
* Eren Bikmaz
* Lehi Briggs
* Morgan Anderson

## Setting Up
This project requires NodeJS and access to our Google Cloud project.
NodeJS can be installed here (Be sure to install npm): https://nodejs.org/en/download/

In order to access our Google cloud project, we must provide "GoogleKey.json"

Once you have these, you can compile the project from the source code. We recommend using visual studio code for the electron/javascript side of the project. The C# component is a visual studio community project. 

Once you have cloned/pulled the repo, open a bash terminal and navigate to JPDesktopAssisstant/electron-gui and run the following commands
    npm install -d
    npm start
This will launch the electron component, which wraps around the actual voice recognition engine. 

You can also build and run the C# component in visual studio community entirely seperate from the GUI.
