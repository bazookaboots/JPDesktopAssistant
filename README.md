# Speech Demo
So, I wrote the speech demo in Visual Studio. It requires some gunet packages in order to run properly. Those packages are NAudio by Mark Heath & Contributors and Google.Cloud.Speech.V1. The former is for formatting the audio read by the mic and the and the latter is to run the cloud libraries. They will take up a lot of space, I'll warn you. You'll have to install both of those packages and then update them. I'm working on a script to be able to run to do that without much overhead.
